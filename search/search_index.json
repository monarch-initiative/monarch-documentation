These releases consist primarily of the following components: Monarch Mapping files via Monarch Mapping Commons Knowledge Graph via Monarch Ingest Data library and API via Monarch-Py Monarch website via Monarch-App Monarch Mapping Commons Monarch Mapping Commons is a repository that contains code used to generate the mapping files used in the creation of the Monarch knowledge graph. The nodes and edges in the knowledge graph come from a variety of sources, and have varying IDs and prefixes. The mapping files are used to map these IDs to IDs in Monarch's preferred namespaces. These mapping files are generated via a Jenkins job on a weekly basis, and are stored in the Monarch Data Bucket . Monarch Ingest (Knowledge Graph) Monarch's knowledge graph is built using the Monarch Ingest pipeline. The pipeline is run on a Jenkins server, and the resulting knowledge graph is uploaded to both Monarch's data bucket on Google Cloud, as well as the KG-Hub AWS S3 bucket. Changes to the Monarch Ingest pipeline are made in the Monarch Ingest repository. After the knowledge graph has been built, the QC Dashboard is used to verify the difference between the new build of the knowledge graph and the previous build. Once the knowledge graph has been verified, additional steps are required to make the new knowledge graph available to the dev, beta, and production versions of the Monarch website. Deploying the Knowledge Graph Deploying to dev While the Github Actions workflow for Monarch App will automatically update and deploy API & UI code to the dev environment, the knowledge graph must be manually deployed to the dev environment. Preparing the environment for deployment: Make sure dependancies from monarch-stack-v3/README.md are installed Ensure secrets are installed in $home/.secrets To deploy the knowledge graph to the dev environment, follow these steps: Checkout (or update) Monarch Stack V3 Source the dev environment: cd deployment && source site-envs/monarch-dev.env Run the provision script to update the dev environment: ./provision.sh After running the provision script to update the dev environment, a manual restart of the Solr container is necessary: gcloud compute ssh --zone us-central1-a monarch-v3-${TF_VAR_env}-manager -- sudo docker service update --force monarch-v3_solr From this point forward, code updates on the dev environment will be automatically deployed and additional work will happen to finish the work planned for the milestone. Ideally changes to the graph will happen early in the release cycle. Deploying to beta Once work on the milestone is complete, we need to tag the release in GitHub then we can deploy to the beta environment. To tag the release, go to the Monarch App and click on releases. Create a new release with the new version number and click generate release notes. Make any changes to the release notes that are necessary (generally none) and click publish release. You may want to set an environment variable for the release version to make it easier to copy and paste the version number in the following steps (update for your current version): RELEASE=\"2024-02-13\" First, copy the KG release from monarch-kg-dev to monarch-kg: gsutil cp -r gs://data-public-monarchinitiative/monarch-kg-dev/${RELEASE} gs://data-public-monarchinitiative/monarch-kg/${RELEASE} Then, we need to copy in the archive: gsutil cp -r gs://monarch-archive/monarch-kg-dev/${RELEASE} gs://monarch-archive/monarch-kg/${RELEASE} Within monarch-stack-v3, copy the latest release env file to a new env, for example: cp site-envs/monarch-2023-10-11.env site-envs/monarch-${RELEASE}.env The date for the environment file name should match the KG release version, rather than today's date. Edit the top two lines in new env to match the latest KG & API versions: export MONARCH_KG_VERSION=\"2023-11-16\" export MONARCH_API_VERSION=\"0.18.1\" Then source the new environment and run provision.sh to create the new VM stack, paying attention to the terrform output to make sure that it's creating VMs with a version name you expect: source site-envs/monarch-2023-11-16.env ./provision.sh Output for the provision script should look something like this: ... Changes to Outputs: + api_image_tag = \"1.0.0\" + env = \"2024-02-13\" + full_prefix = \"monarch-v3-2024-02-13-\" + neo4j_archive_url = \"https://data.monarchinitiative.org/monarch-kg-dev/latest/monarch-kg.neo4j.dump\" + phenio_archive_url = \"https://data.monarchinitiative.org/monarch-kg/2024-02-13/phenio.db.gz\" + project = \"monarch-initiative\" + semsimian_image_tag = \"latest\" + solr_archive_url = \"https://data.monarchinitiative.org/monarch-kg/2024-02-13/solr.tar.gz\" + sqlite_archive_url = \"https://data.monarchinitiative.org/monarch-kg/2024-02-13/monarch-kg.db.gz\" + stack = \"monarch-v3\" + ui_image_tag = \"latest\" + vm_svc_acct_email = \"terraform@monarch-initiative.iam.gserviceaccount.com\" Do you want to perform these actions?

Click on the edit link at the top of the page. Click on Backend Configuration Open the Backend services & backend buckets pull down on the right side and check monarch-v3-{release}-api-backend & monarch-v3-{release}-nginx-backend , leave the other boxes checked, and click ok. Open the Host and path rules section to point beta.monarchinitiative.org to the nginx backend, api-beta.monarchinitiative.org to the api backend, and neo4j-beta.monarchinitiative.org to the neo4j backend. Then for each of these endpoints add /* to the path matcher, and click update. If you get a pop-up window error, you may have forgotten to delete one of the old routes when pointing to the new backend. You will need to redo the configuration if this happens. The load balancer will automatically restart with the new configuration. Then we'll need to confirm that the site is up and running. Get yourself a cup of hot chocolate / ice cold lemonade (season dependent) and settle in to go through the issues in the milestone. Make sure that each issue appears to actually be fixed, and close them with a note that they're confirmed to be working on beta.monarchinitiative.org. (with some additional explanation for externally submitted issues about when the change is expected to be visible on the production site) Deploying to production Edit the load balancer 1. Remove the nginx and api backends from the last release 2.

Starting from a VCF file and a set of phenotypes encoded using the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) it will annotate, filter and prioritise likely causative variants. The program does this based on user-defined criteria such as a variant's predicted pathogenicity, frequency of occurrence in a population and also how closely the given phenotype matches the known phenotype of diseased genes from human and model organism data. The functional annotation of variants is handled by Jannovar and uses any of UCSC , RefSeq or Ensembl KnownGene transcript definitions and hg19 or hg38 genomic coordinates. Variants are prioritised according to user-defined criteria on variant frequency, pathogenicity, quality, inheritance pattern, and model organism phenotype data. Predicted pathogenicity data is extracted from the dbNSFP resource. Variant frequency data is taken from the 1000 Genomes , ESP , TOPMed , UK10K , ExAC and gnomAD datasets. Subsets of these frequency and pathogenicity data can be defined to further tune the analysis. Cross-species phenotype comparisons come from our PhenoDigm tool powered by the OWLTools OWLSim algorithm. The Exomiser was developed by the Computational Biology and Bioinformatics group at the Institute for Medical Genetics and Human Genetics of the Charit\u00e9 - Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, the Mouse Informatics Group at the Sanger Institute and other members of the Monarch initiative . Download and Installation The prebuilt Exomiser binaries can be obtained from the releases page and supporting data files can be downloaded from the Exomiser FTP site . It is possible to use the same data sources for multiple versions, in order to avoid having to download the data files for each software point release. We recommend maintaining a dedicated exomiser data directory where you can extract versions of the hg19, hg38 and phenotype data. To do this, edit the exomiser.data-directory field in the application.properties file to point to the dedicated data directory. The version for the data releases should also be specified in the application.properties file: For example, if you have an exomiser installation located at /opt/exomiser-cli-11.0.0 and you have extracted the data files to the directory /opt/exomiser-data . When there is a new data release, you can change the data versions by specifying the version in the /opt/exomiser-cli-11.0.0/application.properties from # root path where data is to be downloaded and worked on # it is assumed that all the files required by exomiser listed in this properties file # will be found in the data directory unless specifically overridden here. exomiser.data-directory = data # old data versions exomiser.hg19.data-version = 1802 ... exomiser.hg38.data-version = 1802 ... exomiser.phenotype.data-version = 1802 to # overridden data-directory containing multiple data versions exomiser.data-directory = /opt/exomiser-data # updated data versions exomiser.hg19.data-version = 1805 ... exomiser.hg38.data-version = 1805 ... exomiser.phenotype.data-version = 1807 We strongly recommend using the latest versions of both the application and the data for optimum results. For further instructions on installing and running please refer to the README.md file. Running it Please refer to the manual for details on how to configure and run the Exomiser. Demo site There is a limited demo version of the exomiser hosted by the Monarch Initiative . This instance is for teaching purposes only and is limited to small exome analysis. Using The Exomiser in your code The exomiser can also be used as a library in Spring Java applications. Add the exomiser-spring-boot-starter library to your pom/gradle build script. In your configuration class add the @EnableExomiser annotation ```java @EnableExomiser public class MainConfig { } Or if using Spring boot for your application, the exomiser will be autoconfigured if it is on your classpath. ```java @SpringBootApplication public class Application { public static void main(String[] args) { SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args); } } In your application use the AnalysisBuilder obtained from the Exomiser instance to configure your analysis. Then run the Analysis using the Exomiser class. Creation of the Exomiser is a complicated process so defer this to Spring and the exomiser-spring-boot-starter. Calling the add prefixed methods will add that analysis step to the analysis in the order that they have been defined in your code. Example usage: @Autowired private final Exomiser exomiser; ... Analysis analysis = exomiser.getAnalysisBuilder() .genomeAssembly(GenomeAssembly.HG19) .vcfPath(vcfPath) .pedPath(pedPath) .probandSampleName(probandSampleId) .hpoIds(phenotypes) .analysisMode(AnalysisMode.PASS_ONLY) .modeOfInheritance(EnumSet.of(ModeOfInheritance.AUTOSOMAL_DOMINANT, ModeOfInheritance.AUTOSOMAL_RECESSIVE)) .frequencySources(FrequencySource.ALL_EXTERNAL_FREQ_SOURCES) .pathogenicitySources(EnumSet.of(PathogenicitySource.POLYPHEN, PathogenicitySource.MUTATION_TASTER, PathogenicitySource.SIFT)) .addPhivePrioritiser() .addPriorityScoreFilter(PriorityType.PHIVE_PRIORITY, 0.501f) .addQualityFilter(500.0) .addRegulatoryFeatureFilter() .addFrequencyFilter(0.01f) .addPathogenicityFilter(true) .addInheritanceFilter() .addOmimPrioritiser() .build(); AnalysisResults analysisResults = exomiser.run(analysis); Memory usage Analysing whole genomes using the AnalysisMode.FULL will use a lot of RAM (~16GB for 4.5 million variants without any extra variant data being loaded) the standard Java GC will fail to cope well with these. Using the G1GC should solve this issue. e.g. add -XX:+UseG1GC to your java -jar -Xmx... incantation. Caching Since 9.0.0 caching uses the standard Spring mechanisms. To enable and configure caching in your Spring application, use the @EnableCaching annotation on a @Configuration class, include the required cache implementation jar and add the specific properties to the application.properties . For example, to use Caffeine just add the dependency to your pom: <dependency> <groupId> com.github.ben-manes.caffeine </groupId> <artifactId> caffeine </artifactId> </dependency> and these lines to the application.properties : spring.cache.type = caffeine spring.cache.caffeine.spec = maximumSize=300000 Recognition The Exomiser is proud to be recognised by the International Rare Diseases Research Consortium ( IRDiRC ) as an IRDiRC Recognized Resource . This is 'a quality indicator, based on a specific set of criteria, that was created to highlight key resources which, if used more broadly, would accelerate the pace of translating discoveries into clinical applications.' These resources 'must be of fundamental importance to the international rare diseases research and development community' .","title":"Exomiser"},{"location":"Repositories/Exomiser/#exomiser","text":"","title":"Exomiser"},{"location":"Repositories/Exomiser/#details","text":"GitHub exomiser/Exomiser Language Java Description A Tool to Annotate and Prioritize Exome Variants","title":"Details"},{"location":"Repositories/Exomiser/#documentation","text":"","title":"Documentation"},{"location":"Repositories/Exomiser/#the-exomiser-a-tool-to-annotate-and-prioritize-exome-variants","text":"","title":"The Exomiser - A Tool to Annotate and Prioritize Exome Variants"},{"location":"Repositories/Exomiser/#overview","text":"The Exomiser is a Java program that finds potential disease-causing variants from whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing data.

Introduction The purpose of the Biolink Model is to provide a high-level datamodel of biological entities (genes, diseases, phenotypes, pathways, individuals, substances, etc), their properties, relationships, and enumerate ways in which they can be associated. The representation is independent of storage technology or metamodel (Solr documents, neo4j/property graphs, RDF/OWL, JSON, CSVs, etc). Different mappings to each of these are provided. The specification of the Biolink Model is a single YAML file built using linkml . The basic elements of the YAML are: Class Definitions: definitions of upper level classes representing both 'named thing' and 'association' Slot Definitions: definitions of slots (aka properties) that can be used to relate members of these classes to other classes or data types. Slots collectively refer to predicates, node properties, and edge properties The model itself is being used in the following projects: - NCATS Biomedical Data Translator - Monarch Initiative - KG-COVID-19 - KG Microbe - Illuminating the Druggable Genome Organization The main source of truth is biolink-model.yaml . This is a YAML file that is intended to be relatively simple to view and edit in its native form.

The specification of the Biolink Model is a single YAML file built using linkml . The basic elements of the YAML are: Class Definitions: definitions of upper level classes representing both 'named thing' and 'association' Slot Definitions: definitions of slots (aka properties) that can be used to relate members of these classes to other classes or data types.

Boomer implements a search algorithm to find the combined ontology with the highest probability that is also logically coherent. Boomer takes as input ontologies, plus mappings with probabilities for OWL interpretations for each mapping, and produces as output a set of cliques (each representing a group of overlapping mappings which interact with each other when selecting logical interpretations), together with a visualization of each clique. The resulting graphics provide a focused view into problematic tangles of mappings; this lends itself extremely well to an iterative inference process with a curator in the loop.

Documentation dosdp-tools dosdp-tools is a command-line utility for working with DOSDP design patterns and OWL ontologies. Given a YAML design pattern following the DOSDP spec , it can either generate ontology axioms from an input table of terms, or instead generate a SPARQL query that can be used to query an ontology for terms matching the pattern. Releases Pre-packaged releases can be downloaded from here . Building If you don't already have it, install sbt on your system. For Mac OS X, it is easily done using Homebrew : brew install sbt Clone the project from GitHub ( git clone git@github.com:INCATools/dosdp-tools.git ). Change into the project directory: cd dosdp-tools . To compile and build the executable package, run: sbt stage You will find executables for Unix and Windows in target/universal/stage/bin/ . These depend on the libraries in target/universal/stage/lib . Usage Usage dosdp-tools [options] command [command options] Options --catalog : catalog file to use for resolving ontology locations --obo-prefixes : Assume prefixes are OBO ontologies; predefine rdf, rdfs, owl, dc, dct, skos, obo, and oio. --ontology : OWL ontology (provide labels, query axioms) --outfile : Output file (OWL or TSV) --prefixes : CURIE prefixes (YAML) --table-format=STRING : Tabular format: TSV (default) or CSV --template=STRING : DOSDP file (YAML). If a local file is not found at the given path, the path will be attempted as a URL. Commands generate [command options] : generate ontology axioms for TSV input to a Dead Simple OWL Design Pattern --add-axiom-source-annotation : Add axiom annotation to generated axioms linking to pattern IRI --axiom-source-annotation-property=STRING : IRI for annotation property to use to link generated axioms to pattern IRI --generate-defined-class : Computed defined class IRI from pattern IRI and variable fillers --infile : Input file (TSV or CSV) --restrict-axioms-column : Data column containing local axiom output restrictions --restrict-axioms-to=STRING : Restrict generated axioms to 'logical', 'annotation', or 'all' (default) prototype : output \"prototype\" axioms using default fillers for a pattern or folder of patterns query [command options] : query an ontology for terms matching a Dead Simple OWL Design Pattern --print-query : Print generated query without running against ontology --reasoner : Reasoner to use for expanding variable constraints. Valid options are ELK, HermiT, or JFact. terms [command options] : dump terms referenced in TSV input and a Dead Simple OWL Design Pattern --infile : Input file (TSV or CSV) dosdp-tools has four modes: generate , query , prototype , and terms : Generate The generate command creates an ontology from a DOSDP pattern file and an input file of tab-separated filler values. Column names in the TSV file need to match variables defined in the DOSDP. A special defined_class column should provide the IRI for the newly created class instantiating the pattern. A provided ontology is used to find labels for terms, needed to generate annotation values. Example: dosdp-tools generate --obo-prefixes = true --template = exposure_to_chemical.yaml --infile = exposure_to_chemical.tsv --outfile = exposure_to_chemical.ofn --ontology = chebi_import.owl Query The query command queries an ontology for terms that meet the logical patterns defined in a DOSDP pattern file. Instead of performing the query, you can also simply print the generated SPARQL. Example: dosdp-tools query --template = entity_attribute_location.yaml --prefixes = prefixes.yaml --print-query Output: PREFIX rdf : <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> PREFIX rdfs : <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> PREFIX owl : <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> SELECT DISTINCT ?defined_class ( STR ( ?defined_class__label ) AS ?defined_class_label ) ?attribute ( STR ( ?attribute__label ) AS ?attribute_label ) ?entity ( STR ( ?entity__label ) AS ?entity_label ) ?location ( STR ( ?location__label ) AS ?location_label ) WHERE { ?defined_class owl : equivalentClass ?ba95b4a7b13f4a86af50c3e0e1182838 . ?ba95b4a7b13f4a86af50c3e0e1182838 owl : intersectionOf / rdf : rest */ rdf : first ?c90d72646ac64cc19318ca3273f11cd6 . ?ba95b4a7b13f4a86af50c3e0e1182838 owl : intersectionOf / rdf : rest */ rdf : first ?attribute . ?ba95b4a7b13f4a86af50c3e0e1182838 owl : intersectionOf / rdf : rest / rdf : rest rdf : nil . ?c90d72646ac64cc19318ca3273f11cd6 owl : onProperty <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0000052> . ?c90d72646ac64cc19318ca3273f11cd6 owl : someValuesFrom ?7f7e348c174d42f0a76663cc59f21e37 . ?7f7e348c174d42f0a76663cc59f21e37 owl : intersectionOf / rdf : rest */ rdf : first ?75f4eb2eae374a77878c36acda870206 . ?7f7e348c174d42f0a76663cc59f21e37 owl : intersectionOf / rdf : rest */ rdf : first ?entity . ?7f7e348c174d42f0a76663cc59f21e37 owl : intersectionOf / rdf : rest / rdf : rest rdf : nil . ?75f4eb2eae374a77878c36acda870206 owl : onProperty <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000050> . ?75f4eb2eae374a77878c36acda870206 owl : someValuesFrom ?location .

The core datamodel is a Property Graph (PG), represented internally in Python using a networkx MultiDiGraph model . KGX allows conversion to and from: RDF serializations (read/write) and SPARQL endpoints (read) Neo4j endpoints (read) or Neo4j dumps (write) CSV/TSV and JSON (see associated data formats and example script to load CSV/TSV to Neo4j ) Reasoner Standard API format OBOGraph JSON format KGX will also provide validation, to ensure the KGs are conformant to the Biolink Model: making sure nodes are categorized using Biolink classes, edges are labeled using valid Biolink relationship types, and valid properties are used. Internal representation is a property graph, specifically a networkx MultiDiGraph. The structure of this graph is expected to conform to the Biolink Model standard, as specified in the KGX format specification . In addition to the main code-base, KGX also provides a series of command line operations . Example usage Validate: poetry run kgx validate -i tsv tests/resources/merge/test2_nodes.tsv tests/resources/merge/test2_edges.tsv Merge: poetry run kgx merge \u2014merge-config tests/resources/test-merge.yaml Graph Summary: poetry run kgx graph-summary -i tests/resources/graph_nodes.tsv -o summary.txt Transform: poetry run kgx transform \u2014transform-config tests/resources/test-transform-tsv-rdf.yaml Error Detection and Reporting Non-redundant JSON-formatted structured error logging is now provided in KGX Transformer, Validator, GraphSummary and MetaKnowledgeGraph operations. See the various unit tests for the general design pattern (using the Validator as an example here): from kgx.validator import Validator from kgx.transformer import Transformer Validator . set_biolink_model ( \"2.11.0\" ) # Validator assumes the currently set Biolink Release validator = Validator () transformer = Transformer ( stream = True ) transformer . transform ( input_args = { \"filename\" : [ \"graph_nodes.tsv\" , \"graph_edges.tsv\" , ], \"format\" : \"tsv\" , }, output_args = { \"format\" : \"null\" }, inspector = validator , ) # Both the Validator and the Transformer can independently capture errors # The Validator, from the overall semantics of the graph... # Here, we just report severe Errors from the Validator (no Warnings) validator . write_report ( open ( \"validation_errors.json\" , \"w\" ), \"Error\" ) # The Transformer, from the syntax of the input files... # Here, we catch *all* Errors and Warnings (by not providing a filter) transformer . write_report ( open ( \"input_errors.json\" , \"w\" )) The JSON error outputs will look something like this: { \"ERROR\" : { \"MISSING_EDGE_PROPERTY\" : { \"Required edge property 'id' is missing\" : [ \"A:123->X:1\" , \"B:456->Y:2\" ], \"Required edge property 'object' is missing\" : [ \"A:123->X:1\" ], \"Required edge property 'predicate' is missing\" : [ \"A:123->X:1\" ], \"Required edge property 'subject' is missing\" : [ \"A:123->X:1\" , \"B:456->Y:2\" ] } }, \"WARNING\" : { \"DUPLICATE_NODE\" : { \"Node 'id' duplicated in input data\" : [ \"MONDO:0010011\" , \"REACT:R-HSA-5635838\" ] } } } This system reduces the significant redundancies of earlier line-oriented KGX logging text output files, in that graph entities with the same class of error are simply aggregated in lists of names/identifiers at the leaf level of the JSON structure. The top level JSON tags originate from the MessageLevel class and the second level tags from the ErrorType class in the error_detection module, while the third level messages are hard coded as log_error method messages in the code. It is likely that additional error conditions within KGX can be efficiently captured and reported in the future using this general framework. Installation Installing from PyPI KGX is available on PyPI and can be installed using pip as follows, pip install kgx To install a particular version of KGX, be sure to specify the version number, pip install kgx == 0 .5.0 Installing from GitHub Clone the GitHub repository and then install, git clone https://github.com/biolink/kgx cd kgx poetry install Setting up a testing environment for Neo4j This release of KGX supports graph source and sink transactions with the 4.3 release of Neo4j.

The top level JSON tags originate from the MessageLevel class and the second level tags from the ErrorType class in the error_detection module, while the third level messages are hard coded as log_error method messages in the code.

Subsequent dynamic data is delivered to the browser via XMLHttpRequest calls to various backend services, primarily BioLink . The data returned from these calls is then displayed appropriately in the web application. Source: https://github.com/monarch-initiative/monarch-ui Monarch Initiative UI: https://monarchinitiative.org BioLink service to access Monarch's data The VueJS application is built from source code via a modern chain of tools that deal with resource bundling, minification, and transpilation: VueJS UI Rendering framework BootstrapVue styling framework vue-cli for build and asset management webpack for asset bundling The output of the build process is a set of static files including bundled Javascript, CSS, HTML and other media assets. These are then deployed to Netlify where they can be served to users on the internet. BioLink Service There are multiple versions of the BioLink service. See the top of the BioLink file in /api for what versions are available. To easily switch between these versions in the live web-app, add a parameter to your current url like ?api=beta . Directory Structure monarch-ui/ package.json lists build-time and run-time dependencies and a list of npm run -able scripts such as npm run dev . vue.config.js is the configuration that is used by vue-cli to dynamically generate the configuration needed by webpack , which is invoked behind the scenes by vue-cli . publish.sh is a convenience script invoked by npm run ghpublish to copy the developer's current directory into their gh-pages branch and then pushing that to origin . babel.config.js configures the Babel compiler that translates modern Javascript into browser-compatible Javascript. .eslintrc.js specifies the linting rules used by eslint to ensure that code is authored in a more uniform and safe way. monarch-ui/dist/ This directory contains the output of the build process (e.g., from npm run build or npm run ghpublish ). The files here should never be placed in source control or edited; they are generated files. Upon first downloading the repo, or after npm run clean , this directory may not exist. monarch-ui/public/ The vue-cli workflow specifies that the contents of public/ are copied verbatim to the build output directory dist/ , and therefore made available to running web application. team.yaml describes the persons and institutions that make up the Monarch project. This is used by AboutTeam.md to render a Team page. news.yaml is used to drive the HomeNews.md component. robots.txt is used to guide or exclude web-crawling robots. See Robots.txt . index.html is transformed by the build workflow to generate a corresponding dist/index.html . It is NOT copied verbatim. mondo_ids.txt is a tab-demimited list of \"Diseases of the Month\" for all 12 months of the year. It is used to populate the Featured Diseases carousel on the home page. The first field is the Mondo ID; the second indicates which month to display the disease, formatted as YYYY-MM-DD. monarch-ui/src/ This directory and the monarch-ui/public/ (see above) directory contains the primary HTML, Javascript, and CSS source code that will be used to build the web application assets in monarch-ui/dist/ . monarch-ui/src/main.js By convention, vue-cli will use src/main.js as its main entry point. This file performs any global initialization, including the Vue router and the main App.vue . monarch-ui/src/App.vue By convention, App.vue is the root VueJS component that is usually bound to a div in the public/index.html file. This is a good place to configure VueJS and register global components. monarch-ui/src/router.js This file router.js is where the vue-router is loaded and configured. monarch-ui/src/style/ This file contains SCSS or CSS files that might need to be included in several components. The most important file here is variables.scss , which can be included in every component via: <style lang=\"scss\"> @import \"~@/style/variables\"; ... </style> monarch-ui/src/api/ We've tried to isolate external network API access into this directory, so that the rest of the UI can be unaware of the protocol and network issues inherent in making XMLHttpRequest or axios calls. For example, api/bio-link.js is the module that makes REST calls to the BioLink server, and the rest of the UI simply imports from api/bio-link.js . For example: import * as BL from '@/api/bio-link' ; // ... const promise = BL . getNeighborhood ( this . nodeId , this . nodeType ); monarch-ui/src/lib/ This directory is for non-UI utility code that does not access external network APIs (which would be located in src/api/ ). monarch-ui/src/assets/img/ Assets that will be bundled by webpack by require or import . E.g., require('../assets/img/icon-models.png') monarch-ui/src/component/ monarch-ui/src/views/ Both components/ and views/ are properly VueJS components. However, by convention, we isolate top-level routable components into the views/ directory. Both component types are typically just VueJS Single-file Components with extension .vue . In some cases, they will have a .md extension, which means they will be scanned for Markdown prior to becoming VueJS components. See Markdown-based Components below for more information about Markdown in components. Markdown-based Components In an attempt to make it easier for non-developers to contribute enhancements to the prose within the application, we've enabled the capability to define VueJS components that contain Markdown text in their <template> . These files with extension .md (e.g., views/AboutMonarch.md ) are processed at build-time by loaders/vue-markdown-loader-improved.js , which will find Markdown fragments within the template and will translate them (at build-time) into HTML. QuickStart In order to build the application locally, you will need to obtain the source code and follow the QuickStart instructions below. Obtaining the source code If your intent is to eventually contribute source code to the project via pull requests , then we recommend that you first fork the monarch-ui repo and then git clone this fork to your local development machine. Details on using the GitHub Flow workflow for contributing to open source projects are provided in CONTRIBUTING For example, if your GitHub username is abc , and you've forked the monarch-ui repo to your user, then you can get a local copy of your forked repo with (assuming that monarch_stuff exists on your machine) cd monarch_stuff/ git clone git@github.com:abc/monarch-ui.git cd monarch_ui/ For simple evaluation or testing of the monarch-ui , then cloning the primary repo at monarchinitiative/monarch-ui should be sufficient. You will not be able to submit pull requests if you take this route, however. cd monarch_stuff/ git clone https://github.com/monarch-initiative/monarch-ui.git cd monarch_ui/ Environment setup There may be some one-time installation of tools, depending upon whether you have the supported version of NodeJS running. NodeJS v8.12.0 is currently supported, although the project will likely build fine with later versions of NodeJS. If the following command fails, then you probably do not have NodeJS installed: node -v If the above command fails or if it reports a version number significantly different from v8.12.0 , then you should install nvm - Node Version Manager and then install a compatible version of NodeJS. In the event that you do not already have a compatible version of NodeJS installed, we have provided detailed instructions at the end of the CONTRIBUTING document here Installing NodeJS . Project setup Whenever you update your local development machine's source code, and upon initially cloning the repository, you will need to run the following npm install command, which will read the latest downloaded package.json and ensure that your local dependencies are up to date. npm install Local Development: Fast Compile and hot-reload The following command will run webpack in development mode, which runs a webpack-dev-server that detects source code changes and rebuilds the application dynamically and delivers these changes to the browser via hot reload , which often allows the UI to be updated without a full page reload. This speeds up a developer's iterations immensely. npm run serve The command npm run dev is an alias for npm run serve , mostly for the convenience of folks who are used to npm run dev . Production Build: Bundling and Minification In contrast to npm run serve above, which is designed to quickly build and demonstrate changes to the source code, the npm run build command will be more exhaustive in optimizing the build, and will produce a set of assets (Javascript, HTML, CSS, media) that are suitable for deployment to a web server. npm run build Production Test: Build and Serve Although there shouldn't be any difference in behavior between development and production mode builds, there sometimes are. So it has proven convenient to be able to test the production build locally, which is why the npm run buildandserve command was added: npm run buildandserve Linting Usually, we are editing code with a text editor (e.g., SublimeText) that works with ESLint and highlights any linting errors discovered as we edit. It is also possible to manually run ESLint over the entire source. This is a good idea to do before finalizing your code submission. npm run lint Testing Run your unit tests npm run test:unit Run your end-to-end tests npm run test:e2e Run both types of test npm run test","title":"monarch-ui"},{"location":"Repositories/monarch-ui/#monarch-ui","text":"","title":"monarch-ui"},{"location":"Repositories/monarch-ui/#details","text":"GitHub monarch-initiative/monarch-ui Language Vue Description The previous version of the Monarch Initiative website","title":"Details"},{"location":"Repositories/monarch-ui/#documentation","text":"","title":"Documentation"},{"location":"Repositories/monarch-ui/#monarch-ui-readme","text":"This repository contains the source code for the Monarch Initiative web application (aka, the Monarch UI).

For more details, please see the full documentation. Quick Start OntoGPT runs on the command line, though there's also a minimal web app interface (see Web Application section below). Ensure you have Python 3.9 or greater installed. Install with pip : pip install ontogpt Set your OpenAI API key: runoak set-apikey -e openai <your openai api key> See the list of all OntoGPT commands: ontogpt --help Try a simple example of information extraction: echo \"One treatment for high blood pressure is carvedilol.\" > example.txt ontogpt extract -i example.txt -t drug OntoGPT will retrieve the necessary ontologies and output results to the command line. Your output will provide all extracted objects under the heading extracted_object . Web Application There is a bare bones web application for running OntoGPT and viewing results. First, install the required dependencies with pip by running the following command: pip install ontogpt [ web ] Then run this command to start the web application: web-ontogpt NOTE: We do not recommend hosting this webapp publicly without authentication. Model APIs OntoGPT uses the litellm package ( https://litellm.vercel.app/ ) to interface with LLMs. This means most APIs are supported, including OpenAI, Azure, Anthropic, Mistral, Replicate, and beyond. The model name to use may be found from the command ontogpt list-models - use the name in the first column with the --model option. In most cases, this will require setting the API key for a particular service as above: runoak set-apikey -e anthropic-key <your anthropic api key> Some endpoints, such as OpenAI models through Azure, require setting additional details. These may be set similarly: runoak set-apikey -e azure-key <your azure api key> runoak set-apikey -e azure-base <your azure endpoint url> runoak set-apikey -e azure-version <your azure api version, e.g. \"2023-05-15\" > These details may also be set as environment variables as follows: export AZURE_API_KEY = \"my-azure-api-key\" export AZURE_API_BASE = \"https://example-endpoint.openai.azure.com\" export AZURE_API_VERSION = \"2023-05-15\" Open Models Open LLMs may be retrieved and run through the ollama package ( https://ollama.com/ ). You will need to install ollama (see the GitHub repo ), and you may need to start it as a service with a command like ollama serve or sudo systemctl start ollama . Then retrieve a model with ollama pull <modelname> , e.g., ollama pull llama3 . The model may then be used in OntoGPT by prefixing its name with ollama/ , e.g., ollama/llama3 , along with the --model option. Some ollama models may not be listed in ontogpt list-models but the full list of downloaded LLMs can be seen with ollama list command. Evaluations OntoGPT's functions have been evaluated on test data. Please see the full documentation for details on these evaluations and how to reproduce them.

Tips and Tricks Customizing your ODK installation You will likely want to customize the build process, and of course to edit the ontology. We recommend that you do not edit the main Makefile, but instead the supplemental one (e.g. myont.Makefile) is src/ontology An example of how you can customise your imports for example is documented here Migrating an existing ontology repo to the ODK The ODK is designed for creating a new repo for a new ontology. It can also be used to help figure out how to migrate an existing git repository to the ODK structure. There are different ways to do this. Manually compare your ontology against the template folder and make necessary adjustments Run the seed script as if creating a new repo. Manually compare this with your existing repo and use git mv to rearrange, and adding any missing files by copying them across and doing a git add Create a new repo de novo and abandon your existing one, using, for example, github issue mover to move tickets across. Obviously the second method is not ideal as you lose your git history. Note even with git mv history tracking becomes harder. If you have built your ontology using a previous version of ODK, migration of your setup is unfortunately a manual process. In general you do not absolutely need to upgrade your setup, but doing so will bring advantages in terms of aligning with emerging standards ways of doing things. The less customization you do on your repo the easier it should be to migrate. Consult the CHANGELOG.md file for changes made between releases to assist in upgrading. More documentation You will find additional documentation in the src/ontology/README-editors.md file in your repo. The ODK also comes with built in options to generate your own shiny documentation; see for example the PATO documentation here which is almost entirely autogenerated from the ODK. Alternative to Docker You can run the seed script without docker using Python3.6 or higher and Java. See requirements.txt for python requirements. This is, however, not recommended. Running OBO dashboard with ODK Note: this is an highly experimental feature as of ODK version 1.2.24. Note that the display and the scores are under active development and will change considerably in the near future. Example implementation: - https://github.com/obophenotype/obophenotype.github.io ( web ) You need two files to run the ODK dashboard generator: An ODK container wrapper (called odk.sh in the following), similar to the run.sh file in your typical repos src/ontology directory. A dashboard config YAML file (called dashboard-config.yml in the following) With both files, you can then create a dashboard using the following command: sh odk.sh obodash -C dashboard-config.yml The wrapper ( odk.sh ) should contain something like the following: #!/bin/sh # Wrapper script for ODK docker container. # docker run -e ROBOT_JAVA_ARGS='-Xmx4G' -e JAVA_OPTS='-Xmx4G' \\ -v $PWD/dashboard:/tools/OBO-Dashboard/dashboard \\ -v $PWD/dashboard-config.yml:/tools/OBO-Dashboard/dashboard-config.yml \\ -v $PWD/ontologies:/tools/OBO-Dashboard/build/ontologies \\ -v $PWD/sparql:/tools/OBO-Dashboard/sparql \\ -w /work --rm -ti obolibrary/odkfull \"$@\" Note that this essentially binds a few local directories to the running ODK container. The directories serve the following purposes: dashboard : this is where the dashboard is deposited. Look at index.html in your browser. ontologies : this is where ontologies are downloaded to and synced up sparql : an optional directory that allows you to add custom checks on top of the usual OBO profile. This is a minimal example dashboard config for a potential phenotype dashboard: title: OBO Phenotype Dashboard description: Quality control for OBO phenotype ontologies. Under construction. ontologies: custom: - id: wbphenotype - id: dpo base_ns: - http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FBcv environment: ROBOT_JAR: /tools/robot.jar ROBOT: robot The ontologies will, if they exist, be retrieved from their OBO purls and evaluated. There are more options potentially of interest: title: OBO Phenotype Dashboard description: Quality control for OBO phenotype ontologies. Under construction. ontologies: custom: - id: myont mirror_from: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obophenotype/c-elegans-phenotype-ontology/master/wbphenotype-base.owl - id: dpo base_ns: - http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FBcv prefer_base: True profile: baseprofile: \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ontodev/robot/master/robot-core/src/main/resources/report_profile.txt\" custom: - \"WARN\\tfile:./sparql/missing_xrefs.sparql\" report_truncation_limit: 300 redownload_after_hours: 2 environment: ROBOT_JAR: /tools/robot.jar ROBOT: robot mirror_from allows specifying a download URL other than the default OBO purl base_ns allows specifying the set of namespaces considered to be owned by the ontology (only terms in these namespaces will be evaluated for this ontology. Default is http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CAPTIALISEDONTOLOGYID). report_truncation_limit allows truncating long (sometimes HUGE ontology reports) to make them go easier on GITHUB version control. redownload_after_hours : this allows to specify how long to wait before trying to download an ontology (which could be a time consuming process!) again. environment : is currently a necessary parameter but will be made optional in future versions. It allows adding environment variables directly to the config, rather than passing them in as -e parameters to the docker container (both are equivalent though.) profile is an optional parameter that allows specifying your own profile for the quality control (ROBOT) report. By default, this is using the ROBOT report default profile. You can either specify your own profile from scratch, or extend the current default with additional test by using the baseprofile parameter. Find out more about ROBOT profiles here .

It can also be used to help figure out how to migrate an existing git repository to the ODK structure. There are different ways to do this. Manually compare your ontology against the template folder and make necessary adjustments Run the seed script as if creating a new repo. Manually compare this with your existing repo and use git mv to rearrange, and adding any missing files by copying them across and doing a git add Create a new repo de novo and abandon your existing one, using, for example, github issue mover to move tickets across. Obviously the second method is not ideal as you lose your git history. Note even with git mv history tracking becomes harder. If you have built your ontology using a previous version of ODK, migration of your setup is unfortunately a manual process. In general you do not absolutely need to upgrade your setup, but doing so will bring advantages in terms of aligning with emerging standards ways of doing things. The less customization you do on your repo the easier it should be to migrate.

Note that the display and the scores are under active development and will change considerably in the near future. Example implementation: - https://github.com/obophenotype/obophenotype.github.io ( web ) You need two files to run the ODK dashboard generator: An ODK container wrapper (called odk.sh in the following), similar to the run.sh file in your typical repos src/ontology directory. A dashboard config YAML file (called dashboard-config.yml in the following) With both files, you can then create a dashboard using the following command: sh odk.sh obodash -C dashboard-config.yml The wrapper ( odk.sh ) should contain something like the following: #!/bin/sh # Wrapper script for ODK docker container. # docker run -e ROBOT_JAVA_ARGS='-Xmx4G' -e JAVA_OPTS='-Xmx4G' \\ -v $PWD/dashboard:/tools/OBO-Dashboard/dashboard \\ -v $PWD/dashboard-config.yml:/tools/OBO-Dashboard/dashboard-config.yml \\ -v $PWD/ontologies:/tools/OBO-Dashboard/build/ontologies \\ -v $PWD/sparql:/tools/OBO-Dashboard/sparql \\ -w /work --rm -ti obolibrary/odkfull \"$@\" Note that this essentially binds a few local directories to the running ODK container. The directories serve the following purposes: dashboard : this is where the dashboard is deposited. Look at index.html in your browser. ontologies : this is where ontologies are downloaded to and synced up sparql : an optional directory that allows you to add custom checks on top of the usual OBO profile. This is a minimal example dashboard config for a potential phenotype dashboard: title: OBO Phenotype Dashboard description: Quality control for OBO phenotype ontologies. Under construction. ontologies: custom: - id: wbphenotype - id: dpo base_ns: - http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FBcv environment: ROBOT_JAR: /tools/robot.jar ROBOT: robot The ontologies will, if they exist, be retrieved from their OBO purls and evaluated.

Default is http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CAPTIALISEDONTOLOGYID). report_truncation_limit allows truncating long (sometimes HUGE ontology reports) to make them go easier on GITHUB version control. redownload_after_hours : this allows to specify how long to wait before trying to download an ontology (which could be a time consuming process!) again. environment : is currently a necessary parameter but will be made optional in future versions. It allows adding environment variables directly to the config, rather than passing them in as -e parameters to the docker container (both are equivalent though.) profile is an optional parameter that allows specifying your own profile for the quality control (ROBOT) report. By default, this is using the ROBOT report default profile. You can either specify your own profile from scratch, or extend the current default with additional test by using the baseprofile parameter. Find out more about ROBOT profiles here .

To address this, we developed PhEval, a novel framework designed to streamline the evaluation of VGPAs that incorporate phenotypic data. PhEval offers several key benefits: Automated Processes: Reduces manual effort by automating various evaluation tasks, thus enhancing efficiency. Standardisation: Ensures consistency and comparability in evaluation methodologies, leading to more reliable and standardised assessments. Reproducibility: Facilitates reproducibility in research by providing a standardised platform, allowing for consistent validation of algorithms. Comprehensive Benchmarking: Enables thorough benchmarking of algorithms, providing well-founded comparisons and deeper insights into their performance. PhEval is a valuable tool for researchers looking to improve the accuracy and reliability of VGPA evaluations through a structured and standardised approach. For more information please see the full documentation . Download and Installation Ensure you have Python 3.8 or greater installed. Install with pip : pip install pheval See list of all PhEval utility commands: pheval-utils --help Usage The PhEval CLI offers a variety of commands categorised into two main types: Runner Implementations and Utility Commands . Below is an overview of each category, detailing how they can be utilised to perform various tasks within PhEval. Runner Implementations The primary command used within PhEval is pheval run . This command is responsible for executing concrete VGPA runner implementations, that we sometimes term as plugins. By using pheval run, users can leverage these runner implementations to: execute the VGPA on a set of test corpora, produce tool-specific result outputs, and post-process tool-specific outputs to PhEval standardised TSV outputs. Some concrete PhEval runner implementations include the Exomiser runner and the Phen2Gene runner . The full list of currently implemented runners can be found here Please read the documentation for a step-by-step for creating your own PhEval plugin. Utility Commands In addition to the main run command, PhEval provides a set of utility commands designed to enhance the overall functionality of the CLI. These commands can be used to set up and configure experiments, streamline data preparation, and benchmark the performance of various VGPA runner implementations. By utilising these utilities, users can optimise their experimental workflows, ensure reproducibility, and compare the efficiency and accuracy of different approaches. The utility commands offer a range of options that facilitate the customisation and fine-tuning to suit diverse research objectives. Example Usage To add noise to an existing corpus of phenopackets, this could be used to assess the robustness of VGPAs when less relevant or unreliable phenotype data is introduced: pheval-utils scramble-phenopackets --phenopacket-dir /phenopackets --scramble-factor 0 .5 --output-dir /scrambled_phenopackets_0.5 To update the gene symbols and identifiers to a specific namespace: pheval-utils update-phenopackets --phenopacket-dir /phenopackets --output-dir /updated_phenopackets --gene-identifier ensembl_id To prepare VCF files for a corpus of phenopackets, spiking in the known causative variants: pheval-utils create-spiked-vcfs --phenopacket-dir /phenopackets --hg19-template-vcf /template_hg19.vcf --hg38-template-vcf /template_hg38.vcf --output-dir /vcf Alternatively, you can wrap all corpus preparatory commands into a single step.

Mungall Creating a SQLite database from an OWL file There are two protocols for doing this: install build dependencies use Docker In either case: The input MUST be in RDF/XML serialization and have the suffix .owl : use robot to convert if format is different We are planning to simplify this process in future. 1. Build a SQLite database directly This requires some basic technical knowledge about how to install things on your machine and how to put things in your PATH. It does not require Docker. Requirements: rdftab.rs relation-graph 2.3.1 or higher After installing these and putting both relation-graph and rdftab.rs in your path: semsql make foo.db This assumes foo.owl is in the same folder 2. Use Docker There are two docker images that can be used: ODK semantic-sql The ODK image may lag behind docker run -v $PWD :/work -w /work -ti linkml/semantic-sql semsql make foo.db Schema See Schema Documentation The source schema is in LinkML - this is then compiled down to SQL Tables and Views The basic idea is as follows: There are a small number of \"base tables\": statements prefix entailed_edge - populated by relation-graph All other tables are actually views (derived tables), and are provided for convenience. ORM Layer A SemSQL relational database can be accessed in exactly the same way as any other SQLdb For convenience, we provide a Python Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) layer using SQL Alchemy. This allows for code uchlike the following, which joins RdfsSubclassOfStatement and existential restrictions : engine = create_engine ( f \"sqlite:////path/to/go.db\" ) SessionClass = sessionmaker ( bind = engine ) session = SessionClass () q = session . query ( RdfsSubclassOfStatement ) q = q . add_entity ( OwlSomeValuesFrom ) q = q . join ( OwlSomeValuesFrom , RdfsSubclassOfStatement . object == OwlSomeValuesFrom . id ) lines = [] for ax , ex in q . all (): line = f ' { ax . subject } subClassOf { ex . on_property } SOME { ex . filler } ' logging . info ( line ) lines . append ( line ) (this example is just for illustration - to do the same thing there is a simpler Edge relation) Applications The semsql python library is intentionally low level - we recommend using the ontology-access-kit For example: runoak -i db/envo.db search t~biome You can also pass in an OWL file and have the sqlite be made on the fly runoak -i sqlite:envo.owl search t~biome Even if using OAK, it can be useful to access SQL tables directly to do complex multi-join queries in a performant way.

Mappings often lack the metadata needed to be correctly interpreted and applied. For example, are two terms equivalent or merely related? Are they narrow or broad matches? Or are they associated in some other way? Such relationships between the mapped terms are often not documented, which leads to incorrect assumptions and makes them hard to use in scenarios that require a high degree of precision (such as diagnostics or risk prediction). Furthermore, the lack of descriptions of how mappings were done makes it hard to combine and reconcile mappings, particularly curated and automated ones. We have developed the Simple Standard for Sharing Ontological Mappings (SSSOM) which addresses these problems by: (i) Introducing a machine-readable and extensible vocabulary to describe metadata that makes imprecision, inaccuracy and incompleteness in mappings explicit. (ii) Defining an easy-to-use simple table-based format that can be integrated into existing data science pipelines without the need to parse or query ontologies, and that integrates seamlessly with Linked Data principles. (iii) Implementing open and community-driven collaborative workflows that are designed to evolve the standard continuously to address changing requirements and mapping practices. (iv) Providing reference tools and software libraries for working with the standard. In this paper, we present the SSSOM standard, describe several use cases in detail and survey some of the existing work on standardizing the exchange of mappings, with the goal of making mappings Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR).

Or are they associated in some other way? Such relationships between the mapped terms are often not documented, which leads to incorrect assumptions and makes them hard to use in scenarios that require a high degree of precision (such as diagnostics or risk prediction). Furthermore, the lack of descriptions of how mappings were done makes it hard to combine and reconcile mappings, particularly curated and automated ones. We have developed the Simple Standard for Sharing Ontological Mappings (SSSOM) which addresses these problems by: (i) Introducing a machine-readable and extensible vocabulary to describe metadata that makes imprecision, inaccuracy and incompleteness in mappings explicit. (ii) Defining an easy-to-use simple table-based format that can be integrated into existing data science pipelines without the need to parse or query ontologies, and that integrates seamlessly with Linked Data principles. (iii) Implementing open and community-driven collaborative workflows that are designed to evolve the standard continuously to address changing requirements and mapping practices. (iv) Providing reference tools and software libraries for working with the standard. In this paper, we present the SSSOM standard, describe several use cases in detail and survey some of the existing work on standardizing the exchange of mappings, with the goal of making mappings Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR).

The uPheno project aims to unify the annotation of phenotypes across species in a manner analogous to unification of gene function annotation by the Gene Ontology. uPheno 2.0 builds on earlier efforts with a new strategy that directly leverages the work of the phenotype ontology development community and incorporates phenotypes from a much wider range of species. We have organised a collaborative community effort , including representatives of all major model organism databases, to document and align formal design patterns for representing phenotypes and further develop reference ontologies, such as PATO, which are used in these patterns. A common development infrastructure makes it easy to use these design patterns to generate both species-specific ontologies and a species-independent layer that subsumes them. The resulting community-curated ontology for the representation and integration of phenotypes across species serves two general purposes: - Providing a community-developed framework for ontology editors to bootstrap, maintain and extend their phenotype ontologies in a scalable and standardised manner. - Facilitating the retrieval and comparative analysis of species-specific phenotypes through a deep layer of species-independent phenotypes. Architecture UPheno 2.0 comprises three layers. The phenotype base layer contains the phenotype terms defined by the various organism-specific communities, such as C. elegans and Human. The reference ontology layer contains the subsets of external ontologies that are referenced by the base layer such as GO, Chebi and UBERON. The Upheno integration layer is generated automatically from the base layer and the reference ontology layer and contains species independent phenotype terms such as \u2018abnormal skin morphology\u2019.
