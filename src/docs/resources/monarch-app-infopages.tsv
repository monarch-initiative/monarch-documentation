Genotype Ontology	ontology	geno	GENO		CC-BY-4.0	<p>The Genotype Ontology (GENO) is an OWL2 ontology that represents the levels of genetic variation specified in genotypes, to support genotype-to-phenotype (G2P) data aggregation and analysis across diverse research communities and sources. The core of the ontology is a graph decomposing a genotype into smaller components of variation, from a complete genotype specifying sequence variation across an entire genome, down to specific allelic variants and sequence alterations. Structuring genotype instance data according to this model supports a primary use case of GENO to enable integrated analysis of G2P data where phenotype annotations are made at different levels of granularity in this genotype partonomy. GENO also enables description of various attributes of genotypes and genetic variants. These attributes include zygosity, genomic position, expression, dominance, and functional dependencies or consequences of a given variant.</p> <p>In addition to heritable variation in genomic sequence specified by traditional genotypes, GENO also represents transient variation in gene expression, as seen in experiments where genes are targeted by knockdown reagents or overexpressed by DNA constructs at the time a phenotype is assessed. This variation in gene expression is represented in terms of the targeted genes themselves, to parallel representation of sequence variation and facilitate integrated description and analysis of data about any genetic contribution to a measured phenotype.</p> <p>Finally, GENO also supports modelling of G2P associations, focusing on the interplay between genotype, phenotype, and environment. GENO describes provenance and experimental evidence for these associations using the Scientific Evidence and Provenance Information Ontology (SEPIO) model.</p>	An integrated ontology for representing the genetic variations described in genotypes, and their causal relationships to phenotype and diseases		https://github.com/monarch-initiative/GENO-ontology	https://github.com/monarch-initiative/GENO-ontology	https://github.com/monarch-initiative/GENO-ontology		matt@tislab.org	Matt Brush	@mbrush	https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1048-5019

Uberon Anatomy Ontology	ontology	uberon	Uberon	resource-uberon	CC-BY-3.0	Uberon is an anatomical ontology that represents body parts, organs, and tissues in a variety of animal species, with a focus on vertebrates. It has been constructed to integrate seamlessly with other ontologies, such as the Cell Ontology workflows, the Gene Ontology, Trait and Phenotype ontologies, as well as other anatomical ontologies. The ontology includes comprehensive relationships to taxon-specific anatomical ontologies, allowing integration of functional, phenotype and expression data. Currently, Uberon consists of over 13,000 classes representing structures that are shared across a variety of metazoans. As one of the main uses of Uberon is translational science, we have extensive coverage of structures shared between humans and other species. However, thanks to the involvement of many collaborators, we have deep coverage of broad areas of anatomy across diverse taxa. We also make available an ontology called composite-metazoan, which brings in subsets of federated ontologies, with a total of over 40,000 classes.

Existing ontologies contain terms describing common exposure stimuli, exposure routes, and potential exposure media, however unifying terms to describe the exposure process were not yet represented. Utilizing the schema of the Exposure Ontology (ExO), ECTO classes can coordinate the stimulus, route, and exposure components into a single process term for consistent exposure classes. Logical axioms can be used to define the relationships between exposure receptors, ECTO classes, and documented exposure outcomes from the literature. Instance level schemas can also be developed using individual data points as the exposure receptor or exposure outcomes.
