    description: 'GENO is an OWL2 ontology that represents the levels of genetic variation specified in genotypes, to support genotype-to-phenotype (G2P) data aggregation and analysis across diverse research communities and sources. The core of the ontology is a graph decomposing a genotype into smaller components of variation, from a complete genotype specifying sequence variation across an entire genome, down to specific allelic variants and sequence alterations. Structuring genotype instance data according to this model supports a primary use case of GENO to enable integrated analysis of G2P data where phenotype annotations are made at different levels of granularity in this genotype partonomy. GENO also enables description of various attributes of genotypes and genetic variants. These attributes include zygosity, genomic position, expression, dominance, and functional dependencies or consequences of a given variant. In addition to heritable variation in genomic sequence specified by traditional genotypes, GENO also represents transient variation in gene expression, as seen in experiments where genes are targeted by knockdown reagents or overexpressed by DNA constructs at the time a phenotype is assessed. This variation in gene expression is represented in terms of the targeted genes themselves, to parallel representation of sequence variation and facilitate integrated description and analysis of data about any genetic contribution to a measured phenotype. Finally, GENO also supports modelling of G2P associations, focusing on the interplay between genotype, phenotype, and environment. GENO describes provenance and experimental evidence for these associations using the Scientific Evidence and Provenance Information Ontology (SEPIO) model.'

    visual_explainer: 'figure-upheno|||Structure of the uPheno ontology. uPheno is a framework for consistent and logical definition of phenotype categories using ontology design patterns that provides a hierarchical vocabulary of species-neutral phenotype terms under which their species-specific counterparts are grouped. The ontology design templates are based on shared features of existing phenotypic descriptions from various model organisms and represent community consensus. The phenotype pattern template-adherent terms are adopted by species-specific ontologies, thereby contributing to the community-built uPheno framework. uPheno accelerates cross-species inference and computationally amenable comparative phenotype analysis. For example, the interoperable representation of heart phenotypes characterized by increased size, compared with wild-type in distinct species, such as zebrafish and humans, allows the cross-species identification of genes whose alleles can cause similar phenotypes. uPheno contextual hierarchy for increased size of the heart as displayed in the OLS.'

Utilizing the schema of the Exposure Ontology (ExO), ECTO classes can coordinate the stimulus, route, and exposure components into a single process term for consistent exposure classes. Logical axioms can be used to define the relationships between exposure receptors, ECTO classes, and documented exposure outcomes from the literature. Instance level schemas can also be developed using individual data points as the exposure receptor or exposure outcomes.

    description:
      "The Exomiser is a Java program that finds potential disease-causing variants from whole-exome
      or whole-genome sequencing data.

      Starting from a VCF file and a set of phenotypes encoded using the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO)
      it will annotate, filter and prioritise likely causative variants. The program does this based on
      user-defined criteria such as a variant's predicted pathogenicity, frequency of occurrence in a population
      and also how closely the given phenotype matches the known phenotype of diseased genes from human
      and model organism data.

      The functional annotation of variants is handled by Jannovar and uses any of UCSC, RefSeq or Ensembl
      KnownGene transcript definitions and hg19 or hg38 genomic coordinates.

      Variants are prioritised according to user-defined criteria on variant frequency, pathogenicity, quality,
      inheritance pattern, and model organism phenotype data. Predicted pathogenicity data is extracted
      from the dbNSFP resource. Variant frequency data is taken from the 1000 Genomes, ESP, TOPMed, UK10K,
      ExAC and gnomAD datasets. Subsets of these frequency and pathogenicity data can be defined to further
      tune the analysis. Cross-species phenotype comparisons come from our PhenoDigm tool powered by the
      OWLTools OWLSim algorithm."

    description: >
      The Ontology Access Kit (OAK) is for both technical and non-technical users of ontologies.
      Non-technical users can use the command line interface to query ontologies in a variety of ways. Technical
      users can write Python code that uses the OAK library to perform ontology-related tasks.

      OAK provides a collection of interfaces for various ontology operations, including:
      - look up basic features of an ontology element, such as its label, definition, relationships, or aliases
      - search an ontology for a term
      - validate an ontology
      - modify or delete terms
      - generate and visualize subgraphs
      - identify lexical matches and export as SSSOM mapping tables
      - perform more advanced operations, such as graph traversal, OWL axiom processing, or text annotation

      These interfaces are separated from any particular backend, for which there a number of different adapters. This means the same Python API and command line can be used regardless of whether the ontology:
      - is served by a remote API such as OLS or BioPortal
      - is present locally on the filesystem in owl, obo, obojson, or sqlite formats
      - is to be downloaded from a remote repository such as the OBO library
      - is queried from a remote database, including SPARQL endpoints (Ontobee/Ubergraph), a SQL database, a Solr/ES endpoint

    description: >
      The absence of standardised benchmarks and data standardisation for Variant and Gene Prioritisation
      Algorithms (VGPAs) presents a significant challenge in the field of genomic research. PhEval addresses
      this gap. It is a novel framework designed to streamline the evaluation of VGPAs that incorporate
      phenotypic data. PhEval offers several key benefits:

      - Automated Processes: Reduces manual effort by automating various evaluation tasks, thus enhancing efficiency.
      - Standardisation: Ensures consistency and comparability in evaluation methodologies, leading to more reliable and standardised assessments.
      - Reproducibility: Facilitates reproducibility in research by providing a standardised platform, allowing for consistent validation of algorithms.
      - Comprehensive Benchmarking: Enables thorough benchmarking of algorithms, providing well-founded comparisons and deeper insights into their performance.

      PhEval is a valuable tool for researchers looking to improve the accuracy and reliability of VGPA evaluations through a structured and standardised approach.
