      'GENO is an OWL2 ontology that represents the levels of genetic variation specified in
      genotypes, to support genotype-to-phenotype (G2P) data aggregation and analysis across diverse research
      communities and sources. The core of the ontology is a graph decomposing a genotype into smaller components
      of variation, from a complete genotype specifying sequence variation across an entire genome, down
      to specific allelic variants and sequence alterations. Structuring genotype instance data according
      to this model supports a primary use case of GENO to enable integrated analysis of G2P data where
      phenotype annotations are made at different levels of granularity in this genotype partonomy. GENO
      also enables description of various attributes of genotypes and genetic variants. These attributes
      include zygosity, genomic position, expression, dominance, and functional dependencies or consequences
      of a given variant.

      In addition to heritable variation in genomic sequence specified by traditional genotypes, GENO also
      represents transient variation in gene expression, as seen in experiments where genes are targeted
      by knockdown reagents or overexpressed by DNA constructs at the time a phenotype is assessed. This
      variation in gene expression is represented in terms of the targeted genes themselves, to parallel
      representation of sequence variation and facilitate integrated description and analysis of data about
      any genetic contribution to a measured phenotype.

      Finally, GENO also supports modelling of G2P associations, focusing on the interplay between genotype,
      phenotype, and environment. GENO describes provenance and experimental evidence for these associations
      using the Scientific Evidence and Provenance Information Ontology (SEPIO) [<-- link to SEPIO info

      "The Exomiser is a Java program that finds potential disease-causing variants from whole-exome
      or whole-genome sequencing data.

      Starting from a VCF file and a set of phenotypes encoded using the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO)
      it will annotate, filter and prioritise likely causative variants. The program does this based on
      user-defined criteria such as a variant's predicted pathogenicity, frequency of occurrence in a population
      and also how closely the given phenotype matches the known phenotype of diseased genes from human
      and model organism data.

      The functional annotation of variants is handled by Jannovar and uses any of UCSC, RefSeq or Ensembl
      KnownGene transcript definitions and hg19 or hg38 genomic coordinates.

      Variants are prioritised according to user-defined criteria on variant frequency, pathogenicity, quality,
      inheritance pattern, and model organism phenotype data. Predicted pathogenicity data is extracted
      from the dbNSFP resource. Variant frequency data is taken from the 1000 Genomes, ESP, TOPMed, UK10K,
      ExAC and gnomAD datasets. Subsets of these frequency and pathogenicity data can be defined to further
      tune the analysis. Cross-species phenotype comparisons come from our PhenoDigm tool powered by the
      OWLTools OWLSim algorithm."

    description:
      'The Ontology Access Kit (OAK) is for both technical and non-technical users of ontologies.
      Non-technical users can use the command line interface to query ontologies in a variety of ways. Technical
      users can write Python code that uses the OAK library to perform ontology-related tasks.

      OAK provides a collection of interfaces for various ontology operations, including:
      - look up basic features of an ontology element, such as its label, definition, relationships, or
      aliases
      - search an ontology for a term
      - validate an ontology
      - modify or delete terms
      - generate and visualize subgraphs
      - identify lexical matches and export as SSSOM mapping tables
      - perform more advanced operations, such as graph traversal, OWL axiom processing, or text annotation

      These interfaces are separated from any particular backend, for which there a number of different
      adapters. This means the same Python API and command line can be used regardless of whether the ontology:
      - is served by a remote API such as OLS or BioPortal
      - is present locally on the filesystem in owl, obo, obojson, or sqlite formats
      - is to be downloaded from a remote repository such as the OBO library

      - is queried from a remote database, including SPARQL endpoints (Ontobee/Ubergraph), A SQL database,
      a Solr/ES endpoint'

      Automated Processes: Reduces manual effort by automating various evaluation tasks, thus enhancing
      efficiency.
      Standardisation: Ensures consistency and comparability in evaluation methodologies, leading to more
      reliable and standardised assessments.
      Reproducibility: Facilitates reproducibility in research by providing a standardised platform, allowing
      for consistent validation of algorithms.
      Comprehensive Benchmarking: Enables thorough benchmarking of algorithms, providing well-founded comparisons
      and deeper insights into their performance.
      PhEval is a valuable tool for researchers looking to improve the accuracy and reliability of VGPA
      evaluations through a structured and standardised approach.'
